# The Guesser

"The Guesser" is a simple card game project created by me, Guilherme Rocha, to understand more the process of creating a react application from the ground up, utilizing many of the React features, such as useEffect, useRef, useState and many more.

# How to play the game?

After you download and extract all the source code on the zip file to it's own folder, In the project directory, you can run the following command to install the necessary dependencies to run the application without issues:

### `npm install`

After the installation, to run the application in a local server, run the following command:

### `npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The game is about a simple magical card game, where it displays 12 cards on the screen in a random order, and a "Turns" counter at the end of the array of cards. The player must find the match of each card in order to get all of the cards matched. After that, the game will then end because all of the cards have been matched. If the player wants to try again, there's a "Start a New Game" button right above the cards so it can start a new game again, generating 12 new cards in
random positions to try again and get a better score with less "Turns" to finish the game.

### Final Considerations

The music may or may not start when the project is launched in the browser. If it doesn't start automatically, 
you can scroll to the bottom of the page and then, you can find a button named "Play Music" to play it manually and
enjoy this mysterious little theme i selected for the game's ambience.
